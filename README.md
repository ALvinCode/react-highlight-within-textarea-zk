## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-highlight-within-textarea
```
```
yarn add react-highlight-within-textarea
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { HighlightWithinTextarea } from 'react-highlight-within-textarea'

const Example = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("X Y Z and then XYZ");
  const onChange = (value) => setValue(value);
  return (
    <HighlightWithinTextarea
      value={value}
      highlight={/[XYZ]/g}
      onChange= {onChange}
    />
  );
};
```

The highlight property accepts several different types of values to describe 
what will be highlighted.  You can see the various ways to highlight things, 
along with example code, on the 
[demo page](https://bonafideduck.github.io/react-highlight-within-textarea/).

## Properties

placeholder, highlight, onChange, value

**value**: This can either be the text value or a DraftJs [EditorState](https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-editor-state/#internaldocs-banner).

**onChange**: This is called whenever the text value changes.  You must upcate value to accepth this change.

**onDraftJSChange**: Whenever there is any change, including cursor motion, this is called with a EditorState from DraftJS.  This can be used for more advanced interaction with DraftJS.  

**ref**: Standard React ref.

**placeholder**: The placeholder text to print when no value is set.

**highlight**: This specifies what to highlght.  For more info, see the
[demo page](https://bonafideduck.github.io/react-highlight-within-textarea/).


## Known and Potential Issues

The following have not yet been verified to work or have issues.

* Form submit might not work.  To be honest, I don't even know how React works with form submit buttons.
* Accessible Rich Internet Applications [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) may not be supported.
* Reference forwarding probably works, but it hasn't been tested.
* Tab between form elements may not work. I haven't looked into this at all.
